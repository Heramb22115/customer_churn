# **Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline**

## **Project Overview**

This project establishes a complete machine learning pipeline to accurately **predict customer churn** in a subscription-based environment. The primary objective is to move from reactive customer service to **proactive retention strategies** by identifying high-risk customers before they cancel their service.

The pipeline covers the entire data science lifecycle: from data acquisition and in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, through **model training and evaluation**, to final **visualization and stakeholder reporting**.

## **Project Components & Resume Highlights**

| Area | Activity | Technology |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Data Analysis** | Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on customer datasets to identify and quantify key churn factors. | Python, Pandas |
| **Modeling** | Built and evaluated robust **classification models** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) to predict customer churn. | Scikit-learn |
| **Reporting** | Designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** (external) to visualize churn insights, model performance, and high-risk customer lists for stakeholders. | Power BI (External) |

## **Technologies & Libraries**

* **Language:** Python  
* **Data Analysis:** pandas, numpy  
* **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier)  
* **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn, Power BI (External)

## **Repository Files**

| File Name | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| customer\_churn\_dataset-training-master.csv | The main dataset used for training the predictive models. |
| customer\_churn\_dataset-testing-master.csv | The held-out dataset used for final model evaluation. |
| eda.py | Python script responsible for data cleaning, calculating churn rates, and generating all exploratory visualizations. |
| train\_model.py | Python script for data preprocessing, feature engineering (scaling, encoding), training the three classifiers, and outputting performance reports. |
| eda\_\*.png | Visualizations generated by eda.py (e.g., Churn Distribution, Correlation Matrix, Churn Rate by Categorical Feature). |

## **Key Findings & Results**

### **EDA Insights**

The analysis revealed that **Contract Length** and **Tenure** are the most critical predictors of churn. Specifically:

* Customers with **Monthly** contracts have the highest churn probability.  
* Customers with **lower tenure** (newer customers) are significantly more likely to churn.

### **Model Performance**

After training and initial testing, the **Gradient Boosting Classifier** was selected as the optimal model based on the **highest ROC AUC score (0.7240)**, though further hyperparameter tuning is recommended to improve precision for the Churn class.

| Model | Classification Time (s) | Precision (Churn Class) | F1-Score (Churn Class) | ROC AUC Score |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Logistic Regression | 3.66 | 0.53 | 0.69 | 0.6892 |
| Random Forest Classifier | 6.85 | 0.49 | 0.66 | 0.5832 |
| **Gradient Boosting Classifier** | **68.30** | **0.49** | **0.66** | **0.7240** |

**Final Model:** Gradient Boosting Classifier (ROC AUC: 0.7240)

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.  
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy

2. **Perform EDA (Optional):** Run the script to generate and save the analysis plots.  
   python eda.py

3. **Train Models:** Run the main script to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and display the performance metrics in your console.  
   python train\_model.py
