# **Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline**

##  **Project Overview**

This project establishes a complete machine learning pipeline to accurately **predict customer churn** in a subscription-based environment. The primary objective is to move from reactive customer service to **proactive retention strategies** by identifying high-risk customers before they cancel their service.

The pipeline covers the entire data science lifecycle: from data acquisition and in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, through **model training and evaluation**, to final **visualization and stakeholder reporting**.

## **Project Components & Resume Highlights**

| Area | Activity | Technology |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Data Analysis** | Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on customer datasets to identify and quantify key churn factors. | Python, Pandas |
| **Modeling** | Built and evaluated robust **classification models** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) to predict customer churn. | Scikit-learn |
| **Reporting** | Designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** (external) to visualize churn insights, model performance, and high-risk customer lists for stakeholders. | Power BI (External) |

## **Key Findings & Results**

### **EDA Insights**

The analysis revealed that **Contract Length** and **Tenure** are the most critical predictors of churn. Specifically:

* Customers with **Monthly** contracts have the highest churn probability.  
* Customers with **lower tenure** (newer customers) are significantly more likely to churn.

### **Model Performance**

After training and hyperparameter tuning, the **Random Forest Classifier** was selected as the optimal model due to its high predictive accuracy.

| Model | Classification Time (s) | Precision (Churn Class) | F1-Score (Churn Class) | ROC AUC Score |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Logistic Regression | \~1.5 | 0.82 | 0.82 | 0.9090 |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | \~4.2 | **0.99** | **0.99** | **0.9996** |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier | \~3.8 | 0.97 | 0.98 | 0.9984 |

**Final Model:** Random Forest Classifier (ROC AUC: 0.9996)

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.  
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy

2. **Perform EDA (Optional):** Run the script to generate and save the analysis plots.  
   python eda.py

3. **Train Models:** Run the main script to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and display the performance metrics in your console.  
   python train\_model.py
